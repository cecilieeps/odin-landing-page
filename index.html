                        (<i>but if you really wanna know, they are wild dogs).</i>
                        They have selective hearing and act as if you don't exist whenever they see another
                        goober a million miles away but we love them nonethesless.  
                        <br>Fluffy Goobers is a social/dog-sitting group where Samoyed owners can 
                        bring their fluffy cloud for a social afternoon surrounded by other fluffy clouds.

                        at our headquarters at your chosen time. They'll be pampered so much while you're away
                        you will need to drag them home. </p>
